## Core Linux Administration Tasks

### 1) Process and System Monitoring
**Tasks:**
1) Monitor running processes using **ps, top, htop, and pidstat**.
2) Manage processes **(kill, pkill, nice, renice, systemctl)**.
3) Check system performance metrics such as CPU, memory, and disk I/O using **vmstat, iostat, and free**.
4) Monitor log files using **tail, head, less, and journalctl**.

1. Monitor Running Processes:
Tools like ps, top, htop, and pidstat help you inspect and monitor processes.
**Example:**
- **1.1) View running processes related to Jenkins:**
  ```bash
  ps aux | grep jenkins
  ```
  This shows all processes related to Jenkins, along with their PID and memory usage.

- **1.2) Inspect system-wide process details: top**
  ```bash
  top
  ```
  Provides a live view of system processes, along with CPU and memory usage statistics.

  ![top-example](./images/top.png)

- **1.3) Use htop for interactive process management: htop**
  ```bash
  htop
  ```
  - Navigate the process list using arrow keys.
  - Search for Jenkins or Docker processes by pressing / and typing "jenkins" or "docker".

- **1.4) Check detailed stats of a specific process: pidstat**
  ```bash
  pidstat -p <PID>
  ```
   Replace <PID> with the process ID of Jenkins or Docker to see CPU and memory usage.
  
  **Note:**
  The pidstat command is included in the sysstat package, which might not come pre-installed on your EC2 instance.
  You can install it by following these steps:
  
  - **Amazon Linux / Amazon Linux 2 / RHEL / CentOS:**
  ```bash
  sudo yum install sysstat -y
  ```
  **pidstat-jenkins-example:**

  **pidstat-docker-example:**
   ![pidstat-docker-example](./images/pidstat-docker.png)

- **1.5) vmstat (Virtual Memory Statistics):**
    - Purpose: Displays a snapshot of system performance, including CPU, memory, and I/O usage. Ideal for identifying bottlenecks.
      - Key Metrics:
        - CPU: us (user), sy (system), id (idle), wa (waiting for I/O).
        - Memory: free, buff, cache.
        - Disk I/O: bi (blocks in), bo (blocks out)
  **Example Use Cases:**
        - Monitor system performance in real time (every second for 5 intervals):
  ```bash
  vmstat 1 5
  ```
  **Output Example:**

  ![vmstat-example](./images/vmstat.png)

  - r: Number of processes waiting to run (high r = CPU bottleneck).
  - wa: High values indicate I/O bottlenecks (e.g., slow disk or network)
- To detect high I/O wait during Jenkins builds, execute vmstat while a Jenkins job is running. If the 'wa' value is elevated, look into the performance of the disk or the activity of Docker containers.

- **1.6) iostat (Input/Output Statistics):**
    - **Purpose:** This tool provides insights into CPU usage and the I/O performance of storage devices and partitions.
        - **Key Metrics:**
          - **%iowait:** The percentage of CPU time spent waiting for I/O operations to finish. Elevated values suggest possible disk or network bottlenecks.
          - **r/s, w/s:** The number of read and write requests per second, showing the intensity of disk activity.
          - **rkB/s, wkB/s:** Kilobytes read and written per second, indicating the data transfer rate.
          - **%util:** The percentage of time the disk was busy. Values nearing 100% indicate the disk is a bottleneck.

  **Example Use Cases:**
  - **Monitor disk I/O in real time (update every second):**
  ```bash
  iostat -dx 1
  ```
   **Output Example:**

  ![iostat-example](./images/iostat.png)

**How to Use iostat for Docker/EKS Applications?**

  **Practical Example for Docker:**
  
  **Scenario:** A container running a MySQL database is slow.
  
  **1. Run iostat:**
  ```bash
  iostat -dx 1
  ```
  - If %util is consistently above 90% or w_await is high, the disk is overloaded or slow.
  **2. Identify the container causing high disk usage:**
    
  ```bash
  docker stats
  ```
 - Look for the MySQL container's IO metrics.
  - docker stat command output example:
    
     ![dockerstat-example](./images/dockerstat.png)
    

  **3. Solution:**
  - Move the database files to a faster storage backend (e.g., AWS EBS gp3 or io2 volumes).
  - Optimize database queries or reduce IOPS requirements.

 **Check Kubernetes Storage Usage:**

  For EKS, check the Kubernetes storage backends:
  
    - If the application is utilizing AWS EBS volumes, keep an eye on the performance of the attached volume:
    
        - Use AWS CloudWatch Metrics (e.g., VolumeReadOps, VolumeWriteOps) to monitor EBS volume usage.
        
        - Alternatively, on the EKS node, use iostat to check the performance of the /dev/xvda or /dev/nvme* devices.

- **1.7) sar (System Activity Reporter):**
    **Purpose:**
    - The sar command is used to collect, report, and save metrics related to system performance, such as CPU, memory, disk, and network usage. It is 
      particularly helpful for analyzing real-time system activity as well as historical trends from logs that were collected earlier.
    - **Key Metrics Tracked:**
        - **CPU usage:** %user, %system, %iowait, %idle, etc.
        - **Disk I/O:** Transfer rates, wait times, and device utilization.
        - **Memory usage:** Free and used memory, swap activity.
        - **Network usage:** Packet transfer rates and errors over time.
    - **Usage:**
        - **Real-Time CPU Usage:**
    ```bash
    sar -u 5 3
    ```
  - Captures CPU usage in real time every 5 seconds for 3 iterations.

   - Hereâ€™s a complete guide for using the sar command to monitor system activity, which includes enabling necessary components and troubleshooting steps:

   **Step 1: Install Sysstat**
       i) Install the package:
    ```bash
    sudo yum install sysstat -y
    ```
       ii) Verify the installation:
    ```bash
    sar -V
    ```
  
  **Step 2: Enable and Start the Sysstat Service**
  
  i) Enable the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sysstat
    ```
  ii) Start the service:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sysstat
    ```
  iii) Verify the service is running:
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl status sysstat
    ```

  ![sar-v-example](./images/sar-v.png)

  **Step 3: Configure Data Collection**

  The sar command depends on regular data collection performed by the sa1 script, which is activated through cron jobs or systemd timers.
  
  **Option A: Using Cron Jobs**
  
  Check if a cron job exists:
  
    i) Configure a cronjob:
  
    ```bash
    sudo crontab -e
    ```
   - Add the following line to collect system activity data every 10 minutes:
  
    ```bash
    */10 * * * * /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 1 1
    ```
    
    ii) Verify the cron job:
  
    ```bash
    sudo crontab -l
    ```
    
  ![sar-cron-example](./images/sar-cron.png)

  **Option B: Using Systemd Timers**
  
  - If your system uses systemd timers instead of cron:
    
  i) Check for sysstat timers:
    
  ```bash
  sudo systemctl list-timers | grep sysstat
  ```
    
  ii) Enable and start the timer:
  
    ```bash
    sudo systemctl enable sysstat-collect.timer
    sudo systemctl start sysstat-collect.timer
    ```
    
  ![sar-timer-example](./images/sar-timer.png)

  **Step 4: Verify Data Collection**
  
  Data collected by sysstat is stored in /var/log/sa/.
  
   i) Check for data files:
 
   ```bash
    ls -l /var/log/sa/
    ```
    Files like sa26 (raw data) and sar26 (human-readable reports) should appear.
  
  ii) Manually test data collection: To verify that sa1 is working, manually trigger it:

  ```bash
    sudo /usr/lib64/sa/sa1 1 1
  ```
  Check if a new file appears in /var/log/sa/

**Step 5: Use the sar Command**

Once data is collected, you can use sar to analyze system performance:

  i) Overall CPU usage for the current day:

  ```bash
    sar -u
  ```
  ![sar-u-example](./images/sar-u.png)

  ii) Memory Usage:

  ```bash
    sar -r
  ```

  ![sar-r-example](./images/sar-r.png)

  iii) Network Usage:

  ```bash
    sar -n DEV
  ```
  ![sar-n-example](./images/sar-n.png)

  iv) Disk I/O:

  ```bash
    sar -d
  ```
  ![sar-d-example](./images/sar-d.png)

  v) Load Average:

  ```bash
    sar -q
  ```
  ![sar-q-example](./images/sar-q.png)

  vi) Historical Data Analysis:

  - View data from a specific log file (e.g., /var/log/sa/sa26):

  ```bash
    sar -f /var/log/sa/sa26
  ```
